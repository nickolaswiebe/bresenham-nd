# N-dimensional Bresenham line algorithm

The Bresenham line algorithm is often presented in code as an implementation specialized to the 2D case, but the algorithm can generate lines in any number of dimensions.  I haven't seen this written out anywhere, and it's an interesting generalization, so I thought I'd put it here.  To be completely honest, even after reading many explanations, I'm not entirely sure why this code works, but it does.
